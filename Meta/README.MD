I was learning about Metaclass and thought why not give it a try. The code looks out for all the parameters passed in class constructor and generates the property element for it.

I was amazed by python's flexibility and power, after C it's the only language i have seen so far which is simple yet powerful. The code generates getter , setter and deleter function on the fly !!! . My code is based upon the material i studied on the url 'http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/14/python-metaclasses-by-example' . It's nice article and provides easy and thorough explanation on python Metaclasses .
