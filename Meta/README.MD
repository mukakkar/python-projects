I was learning about Metaclass and thought why not give it a try . The code looks out for all the parameters passed in class constructor
and generate the property element for it . 

I was amazed by python's flexibilty and power , after C it's the only language i have seen so far which is simple yet powerful . 
The code generates getter , setter and deleter function on the fly !!! . My code is based upon the description on url 'http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/14/python-metaclasses-by-example'
