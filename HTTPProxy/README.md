This a multithreaded HTTP proxy which i developed for my testing . You can modify the HTTP buffer as per your requirement 
To start the server just type python main.py on the command prompt . it will start a server on port 8080 , change the port as per your needs

Note : I tested the server on pyton 2.7 , in case you have difefrent python version you might have to tweak in the code
